Space complexity : sum of inout space and auxillary space
    input-space: space required to store the problem.
    auxillary space : space required to solve the problem.

Example : c = a+b 
    input space : a,b ie O(1)
    auxillary space : c ie O(1)

Note : never manipulate the given input data even if in order to save space.
    This might be tempting but not a preferred approach.

Usual server space : 1 second ~ 10^8operations.
