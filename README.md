# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository is where I track all the codes I finish as a part of my problem-solving routine. Here, you'll find implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different programming languages.

## Folder Structure

- **Algorithms**: Contains implementations of various algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Contains implementations of different data structures.
- **Problems**: Contains solutions to coding problems from various sources (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.).
- **Utilities**: Contains utility functions or helper classes used across the repository.


## Languages Used

I primarily use C++ for implementing data structures and algorithms.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs, optimizations, or want to add more implementations, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

## Resources

Here are some resources I find helpful for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms:

- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-javascript)
